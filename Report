Everyday,  world has faced several terrorism activities and threats jeopardizing peace of the socity in different nooks. Hence, with the 
Global Terrorism dataset which contains rich information regarding attacks and targetd cities along with their geospatial cordinates, attack time, 
we can visualize and see the surprising insights. The richness of the dataset has convinced us to achieve fruitful visualizations.

Contribution:
Each team member has contributes and fulfild the following tasks.

Dataset: Global Terrorism Database
More than 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide, 1970-2017

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

This dataset contains 100 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes
 records of 180,000 records . Data can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd
